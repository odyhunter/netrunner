(defn resolve-ability
  "Resolves an ability defined by the given ability map. Checks :req functions; shows prompts, psi games,
  traces, etc. as needed; charges costs; invokes :effect functions. All card effects and most engine effects
  should run through this method.

  All keys that can be used in an ability map:
  COMMON KEYS
  :req -- a 4-argument function that must return true or false. If false, the ability will not be resolved.
  :cost -- a vector of costs to charge, for example [:credit 1 :click 1]. If the costs cannot be paid, the ability
           will not be resolved.
  :msg -- either a string or a 4-argument function that returns a string. Prints to the log when the ability is finished.
  :effect -- a 4-argument function that will be called if the ability will be resolved (if :req is true or not present,
             costs can be paid, and any prompts are resolved.)
  :player -- manually specifies which player the ability should affect, rather than leave it implicit.

  PROMPT KEYS
  :choices -- this key signals a prompt of some kind. Can be:
      * a 4-argument function returning a vector of cards or strings -- user chooses one option.
        Called a 'choice' prompt.
      * the keyword :credit -- user chooses an integer up to their current credit amount.
      * the keyword :counter -- user chooses an integer up to the :counter value of the given card.
      * a map containing the keyword :number with a value of a 4-argument function returning an integer -- user
        chooses an integer up to the value of the map.
      * a map containing either: 1) the keyword :card with a value of a 1-argument function returning true or false,
        or 2) the keyword :req with a value of the req 5-fn returning true or false. Triggers a 'select' prompt
        with targeting cursor; only cards that cause the 1-argument function to return true will be allowed.
  :prompt -- a string or 4-argument function returning a string to display in the prompt menu.
  :not-distinct -- true if the prompt should not collapse :choices entries of the same string to one button.
                   Defaults to false.
  :cancel-effect -- if the prompt uses a Cancel button, this 4-argument function will be called if the user
                    chooses Cancel.

  OTHER PROMPTS
  :psi -- a map that starts a psi game. Has keys :equal and :not-equal, whose values are 4-argument functions
          which are triggered when the game resolves.
  :trace -- a map that starts a trace. Has a :base key that is either an integer or a 4-argument function
            returning an integer for the base strength. The map is otherwise a normal ability map that can
            contain :req, :effect, or any other key in an ability; the :effect is only triggered if the trace
            succeeds. Can also have a key :kicker that is an ability map with key :min, whose effect triggers
            if the trace strength matches or exceeds the :min value. (Constellation ice.)

  SIMULTANEOUS EFFECT RESOLUTION KEYS
  :interactive -- when simultaneous effect resolution has been enabled for a specific event, the user receives
                  a menu of cards that handle the effect and get to choose the order of their resolution. This menu is
                  only shown if at least one ability handling the event has an :interactive function that returns true.
                  If none are interactive, then all handlers will be resolved automatically, one at a time in an
                  arbitrary order. In general, handlers should be marked ':interactive (req true)' if they have
                  important order-of-effect interactions with other cards. The :interactive function can be coded to
                  have smarter logic if necessary -- see Replicator, which is only interactive if there is another
                  copy of the installed card remaining in the Stack.
  :silent -- any handler that does not require user interaction under any circumstances can be marked :silent. If a
             handler's :silent function returns true, then no menu entry will be shown for the handler. In that case,
             the ability will only be resolved once all non-silent abilities are resolved. Example: AstroScript has no
             important interactions with other 'agenda scored' effects, and doesn't care when an agenda token is placed.
             Example: Hayley Kaplan will not show a prompt if there are no valid targets in the grip.

  OTHER KEYS
  :once -- its only value is :per-turn; signifies an effect that can only be triggered once per turn.
  :once-key -- by default, each :once is distinct per card. If multiple copies of a card can only resolve
               some ability once between all of them, then the card should specify a manual :once-key that can
               be any value, preferrably a unique keyword.
  :optional -- shows a 'Yes/No' prompt to let the user decide whether to resolve the ability.
  :makes-run -- indicates if the ability makes a run.
  :install-req -- a function which returns a list of servers a card may be installed into"
